# SoftBodySimulation

## Installation & System Requirements

## Description
### Brief Synopsis
We aim to create a soft-body simulation that will be user-interactive. Currently, we plan to render the visual elements of our project within Processing, with a minimum viable product resembling a functional simulation of a soft 3D ball under the effect of gravity and other obstacles. Afterwards, the product will be expanded to encompass more interactive components such as simulation reactions to user mouse inputs, impact with other obstacles, as well as other combinations of collisions.

## Commit Log
05/20 - Jacob: I made constructors and instance variables for the main classes, including the for loop to create the vertices in the ball.
05/21 - Jacob: I added edges to the ball, connecting the vertices in the ball constructor.
05/23 - Kitty:
05/23 - Jacob: I added the physics to make the springs connecting the vertices pull and push, as intended.
05/24 - Jacob: I attempted to fix some of the bugs resulting from the wall-interaction. I made some progress, but there is still some unwanted behavior when the ball hits a wall.
